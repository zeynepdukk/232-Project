# Basic Text Editor
This project is a simple compiler written in C that processes commands for manipulating arrays. The compiler reads instructions from a file, parses them, and generates corresponding C code for various operations on arrays such as declaration, initialization, arithmetic operations, and printing.

## Features
#### Declare Arrays: Define arrays with specified names, sizes, and types.
#### Read from File: Read array values from a file and initialize arrays accordingly.
#### Print Arrays: Generate code to print the contents of an array.
#### Arithmetic Operations: Perform arithmetic operations on arrays (addition, copy, etc.).
#### Copy Arrays: Copy the contents of one array to another.
## Files
main.c: Contains the main logic for parsing commands and generating code.
test.txt: Example input file containing commands for the compiler.
